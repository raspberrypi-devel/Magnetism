# Magnetism
test theory of magnetism

Here's how it works: A magnetic field pulls and pushes electrons in certain objects closer to them, making them move. 
Metals like copper have electrons that are easily moved from their orbits. 
If you move a magnet quickly through a coil of copper wire, the electrons will move - this produces electricity.

simple  description of how  magnets  work:
In magnets the molecules are uniquely arranged so that their electrons spin in the same direction. 
This arrangement of atoms creates two poles in a magnet, a North-seeking pole and a South-seeking pole. 
The magnetic force in a magnet flows from the North pole to the South pole.
